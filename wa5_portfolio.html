<p> I started my extensive work with robotics during my Freshman year at Thomas Jefferson High School. Between my Freshman and Sophomore years, I served as Co-Captain 
    for Team #6245 as we participated in FIRST Tech Challenges (FTC). Our team placed first at the regional competition and ended up in the top ten at the state 
    competition during both competition seasons. Aside from my administrative duties I worked as the primary designer, mechanical, and electrical engineer. During my 
    Junior and Sophomore year, I switched to participating in FIRST Robotics Competitions (FRC). Both years I continued to serve as a Co-Captian for Team #3648. In 
    addition to my previously mentioned duties, I became the primary troubleshooter, in the event we had a problem we hadn't encountered before. In my Senior year, 
    our team placed first in the Colorado Regional and afforded ourselves the opportunity to compete at the international competition in Houston, Texas.
