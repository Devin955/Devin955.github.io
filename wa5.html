<div class="Paragraphs">
<p> I'm an undergraduate student in the College of Media, Communication, and Information at the University of Colorado Boulder studying Information Science. 
    Additionally, I am minoring in Philosophy, specializing in critical thinking. The time that I have and continue to spend at the University of Colorado 
    Boulder is split between my academics, employment, and recreational activities. The coursework I am currently working on focuses on developing my data analysis 
    and visualization skills. Furthermore, I am currently involved in a number of community engagement programs/projects wherein I serve as a project leader and manager.
