<p>What has happened with regards to GameStop’s stock rising meteorically due to the collective action of redditors is 
    nothing short of astounding. However, while it is astounding it is not entirely unexpected. After the recession of 
    2008 more people in the general public became more aware of the inner workings of the large Wall Street investment 
    firms and banks. As the years have gone on, more and more people have become acutely aware of not only what happened 
    to cause the recession, but what came after. Most would think offhand that new regulations were put in place and/or 
    that the ones responsible were thrown in jail. None of which is true.
</p>
<p>For the most part, Wall Street went back to business as usual. It has been estimated that approximately five trillion 
    dollars, eight billion jobs, six million homes, and half a million lives were lost as a result of the 2008 recession. 
    For those in the know it became clear that the government was not going to step in, in an attempt to rectify the situation. 
    Rather, they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Economic_Stabilization_Act_of_2008">bailed out</a> the ones 
    who had caused the calamity in the first place. The government is supposed to act as an extension of the will of the populous. 
    In this regard, they failed.
</p>
<p>When governments and institutions fail those they are supposed to operate on the behalf of, people tend to find another way 
    of balancing the scales. This has become evermore true with the proliferation of various social media platforms. The world 
    is more connected now than it has ever been, and with that comes unprecedented power being endowed on the people of the world. 
    One such social media platform is reddit. The subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">r/wallstreetbets</a> 
    is of particular interest with regards to this particular story, seeing as it is their efforts which have ultimately brought about 
    this momentous moment in financial history. When people find themselves sharing interests, circumstances, etc. they are likely to 
    find that they also share a similar desire to act accordingly.
</p>
<p>Up until now GameStop stock had been plummeting. GameStop, being a video games and merchandise retailer, relies heavily upon 
    its brick-and-mortar stores to generate revenue. The problem is that for the past several years the world of video games has 
    been going increasing digital. Digital downloads themselves have put a serious dent in GameStop’s viability. To add insult to 
    injury, the COVID-19 pandemic hit. And while 
    <a href="https://qz.com/1904276/everyone-is-playing-video-games-during-the-pandemic/">sales of video games went up</a> 
    during this time do to quarantine mandates and many people staying at home more, it also caused people to choose digital options 
    more than in-person options. The long and short of it is that GameStop was at an all time low and Wall Street knew. So they did 
    what they do best and bet that GameStop stock would remain low.
</p>
<p>You can imagine the hysteria that ensued when the stock shot up. While for some there was money to be had, this move on the part 
    of the collective seems as though it was meant primarily as a warning. A warning to the big banks and failing regulators. In a way 
    it sets a precedent that there can and will be backlash in some fashion should things go to far awry. Only time will tell whether 
    or not this helps to tip the scales towards balance or catastrophe.
