<p> Of all the expositional mediums utilized during the course of the semester, Jupyter Notebook is probably the one I am the most 
    familiar with. I would also say that it is likely the one I am the fondest of. While a Jupyter notebook does a very good job of 
    displaying code, computational results, visualizations, etc.; it has great storytelling potential given various other features it 
    has. Take for example being able to add markdown cells and links to specific cells as a means of navigation. Having a clear and 
    cohesive Jupyter Notebook allows for someone to tell the story of their information/data exploration. It would appeal to both those 
    who are technical and those that are not. What ultimately makes a Jupyter notebook stand out is when the final product is exported 
    as an HTML file. Instantaneously you have a clean webpage that could work as a stand-alone page for a website. Jupyter notebooks 
    offer the best option for the widest range of viewers.</p>
<p> Working with RevealJS was a rather unique experience as it was unlike any time when I worked with anything similar. Though more 
    complex to set up and implement than your average PowerPoint presentation, RevealJS has a lot of unique implementations that make 
    it ideal for exposition. Though it utilizes fairly simple mechanisms and aesthetics, RevealJS is robust enough such that the entire 
    “deck” can be customized exactly the way you want. It would seem like the ideal choice were one trying to create a comprehensive 
    set of instructions or documentation. Enthusiasts and industry professionals would definitely be interested in that sort of 
    exposition.</p>
<p> While I greatly enjoyed the opportunity to get hands-on with more technological tools (HTML, CSS, RevealJS, Altair, etc.) I still 
    have a certain fondness for more traditional exposition tools. The traditional paper, PowerPoint, and presentation video are all 
    still highly effective expositional tools that most people are familiar with. Further instruction regarding project planning, 
    research methodology, conversational interaction, and oration would have been nice to have. Technical mastery can only account for 
    so much in Information Science and its associated fields. Other aspects should be more closely examined so as to determine their 
    effectiveness when teaching coursework.</p>
