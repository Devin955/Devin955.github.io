<div class="Paragraphs">
<p> My career aspirations lie with being afforded the opportunity to work in the fields of Information Technology and Project Management/Development. I have been 
    lucky in that I have spent years developing requisite skills through my extensive work as a Systems Administrator, Desktop Support Technician, Course Instructor, 
    and Co-Captain for competition robotics. My adaptive resourcefulness has been my greatest strength in that I have always had a means by which I can solve a problem.
